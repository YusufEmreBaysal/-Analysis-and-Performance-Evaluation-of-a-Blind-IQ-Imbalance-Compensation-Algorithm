# -Analysis-and-Performance-Evaluation-of-a-Blind-IQ-Imbalance-Compensation-Algorithm
I contributed to a research team on RF Fingerprinting, collaborating with professors and research assistants from various universities. Our main project focused on frequency-independent IQ Imbalance models and compensation methods, which also served as my thesis subject.

Within the project, we analyzed the "Blind IQ Imbalance Compensation (Moseley, 2006)" algorithm and extensively tested it with Monte Carlo simulations using IEEE Non-HT 802.11a packets in different channel scenarios on MATLAB, in comparison to the widely used "Adaptive IQ Imbalance Compensation (Antilla, 2007)" algorithm. The results of our work demonstrated that the "Blind IQ Imbalance Compensation" algorithm, which was the subject of my thesis, is a successful algorithm with the potential for industrial use.
